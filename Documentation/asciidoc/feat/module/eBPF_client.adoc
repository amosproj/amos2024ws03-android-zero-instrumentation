=== eBPF client (User)

==== Overview

* spawns eBPF-Program
* communicates with eBPF maps to access and process collected meta-data
* full system capabilities such as any other privileged application

==== Requirements

===== Functional

* accept runtime configuration via configuration-file when starting
* configuration is changeable during runtime
* load/ unload eBPF programs on configuration change
* provides a list of all known observability features to clients, by evaluating Linux Kernel build flags
* caches some events (50MB) until first client connects
* transform data received from eBPF maps to specified format for an observability feature
* streams observability features to clients (UI) on request
* collects data even without connected clients

===== Non functional 

* low memory/ CPU footprint
* use Rust programming language/ runtime for development 
* (cross)-compilable from Linux amd64 host
* runs on `aarch64` and `x86_64`
* build with frame-pointer enabled and dwarf debug symbols
* logging of critical events via `logd`

==== Use-Case

===== Enable `app-jni-leak` for an application

Precondition:

* observability feature `app-jni-leak` enabled

Action:

* client tells eBPF client to observe JNI references for PID|package 

Expected behavior:

* either load an eBPF program or re-configure a running eBPF program to collect JNI references data
* on each change transform data passed via eBPF maps to specified observability feature format
* transmit to client, if connected

==== Future

* pass data through to observability-pipeline (e.g. OTel collector)
