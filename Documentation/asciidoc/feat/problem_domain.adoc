== Problem Domain

* High amount of component changes done every week
* Changes from various suppliers are integrated and smoke-tested
* Large amount of functional requirement testing is done by customers
  * e. g. bench test / car
* Many error reports for functional issues caused by non-functional requirement (performance)
* Correlating cross-cutting issues (e. g. OOM, CPU starvation) to actual functional issues is hard without additional meta-data
* Re-testing with additional instrumentation necessary, if possible (e. g. other supplier)
