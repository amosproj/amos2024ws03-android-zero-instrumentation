== Goal

Implement a component capable of recoding pre-configured events using eBPF, live event processing/ aggregation and on demand visualization by evaluating previous work (exploitive), while fulfilling following requirements:

* Zero instrumentation on application/ system level
* Low runtime overhead (CPU, memory)
* Always-on
* Runs on Android 13 and higher
* Runtime configuration
* Real time visualization of Logs/ Metrics
