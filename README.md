## Product Mission

**ZIOFA** (Zero Instrumentation Observability for Android) aims to implement observability use cases relevant to performance specified by our industry partner using eBPF. Examples include tracing long-running blocking calls, leaking JNI indirect references or signals like SIGKILL sent to processes, all without instrumenting the observed application itself.  
The eBPF programs are loaded and unloaded using a **backend daemon** running as root that will collect metrics and send them to a client.  For displaying these metrics to the user, we are implementing an **on-device UI** that can display visualizations for these use cases and allow for configuration of the enabled use cases, but **using a decoupled Client SDK** so that future work may easily make the data accessible the external processing.

## Prerequisites

The easiest way to get all dependencies is to use the provided development shell in `flake.nix`. For that you will need [Nix](https://nixos.org/download/).
Additionally you can use a tool like [`direnv`](https://github.com/direnv/direnv) to automatically load the environment for this repository.

The shell will setup:

- The rust nightly toolchain (nightly is required currently for ebpf because of the unstable [`build-std`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/unstable.html#build-std) feature)
- The [`bpf-linker`](https://github.com/aya-rs/bpf-linker/)
- The Android SDK and NDK
- The [`cargo-ndk`](https://github.com/bbqsrc/cargo-ndk) package for compiling for rust for android
- The [`protobuf`](https://protobuf.dev/) programs for generating grpc server and client code

## Build & Deploy
### Emulator Setup

As we need a modified version of Android, we cannot use the standard system images that come with the default Android SDK.
To make development easier, a custom Android SDK is loaded into your environment using the nix development shell.

> [!NOTE]
> The Android SDK shipped with the shell is built of the standard parts with everything necessary for building Android Apps.
> The only "custom' part is the system image, which was build externally and is currently hosted on S3.
> The image can be also downloaded manually from [sdk-repo-linux-system-images.zip](https://ftrace-emu.nbg1.your-objectstorage.com/emulator_car64_x86_64/sdk-repo-linux-system-images.zip) with its manifest stored in [package.xml](https://ftrace-emu.nbg1.your-objectstorage.com/emulator_car64_x86_64/package.xml).
> You can also download and unzip the system image to `$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/system-images/android-VanillaIceCream/android-automotive/x86_64` manually and copy the `package.xml` to that directory as well.

This sdk includes the automotive system image, which is built with a custom kernel having `CONFIG_FTRACE_SYSCALLS=y` set.
To create an emulator using that image, you can use the `avdmanager` tool also provided with the SDK:

```
avdmanager create avd -n YOUR_AVD_NAME  -k 'system-images;android-VanillaIceCream;android-automotive;x86_64' --device automotive_1080p_landscape
```

This can be started with the `emulator` tool like this:

```
emulator @YOUR_AVD_NAME
```

### Frontend
The simplest way to build and test everything is the following command inside of `frontend/` (this will take a while):
```
./gradlew build
```

The apks for each build configuration are located in `frontend/app/build/outputs/apk/`.

To install the application using the real backend on your device or emulator, run either `./gradlew installRealDebug` or `adb install path/to/real/app.apk`

There are other flavors available, for example `installMockDebug`, for a frontend using fake data instead of the real backend.
This is mainly interesting for development purposes.

In order to view the full list of tasks configured in gradle, run
```
./gradlew tasks
```

### Backend
#### All in one deploy
If you'd like to build and run the daemon all in one command, you can use
```
cargo xtask daemon
```

This will ask you for root privileges to run the built executable.

By running
```
cargo xtask daemon --android
```
the executable won't start on your device but instead on an adb reachable android device or emulator by pushing it to `/data/local/tmp/backend-daemon` on the device and running it with root there.

#### Do it youself deploy
To just build the daemon, run the following command inside of `rust/` for your desired architecture:
```
AYA_BUILD_EBPF=true cargo ndk -t x86_64 build --package backend-daemon
AYA_BUILD_EBPF=true cargo ndk -t arm64-v8a build --package backend-daemon
```
You can then proceed to copy the executable (`rust/target/debug/backend-daemon`) to wherever you like and run it. You need root privileges in order to run it.

## Usage
The app can be used like any other android app. Just open it from the device launcher.

### Visualize

This screen offers visualizations for different kinds of events. 
You can select the package you want to inspect, the kind of metric that interests you and time intervals.

### Configuration

The configuration screen allows you to select options per process.

### Reset

This empties the configuration and allows for a clean restart.
